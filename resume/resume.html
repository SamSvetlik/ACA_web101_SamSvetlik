            <h1> AREAS OF EXPERTISE</h1>
                <p>I signed many landmark bills into law during my first two years in office. The main reforms include: the Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare"); the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, I signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, I increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. </p>
